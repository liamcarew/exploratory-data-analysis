# one possible problem is that we might not have gapminder data for every country in
# the world. Another is that names might not match up exactly. Let's check on this.

# gapminder countries
gapnames <- as.character(unique(gapminder$country))
gapnames
# nearth countries
nenames <- unique(world$name_long)
nenames
# number of countries in gapminder not in nearth
sum(!(gapnames %in% nenames))
# which ones 
gapnames[!(gapnames %in% nenames)]
# we could go back and see if they really aren't there, or just a difference in 
# spelling. For now, we'll just assume we don't have data for these countries and 
# move on -- there are not too many of these tricky-to-handle countries

# extract African countries from gapminder
gapminder <- gapminder %>% filter(continent == "Africa") 
# extract African countries from world
africa <- world %>% filter(continent == "Africa") 

# we only need the geometry column from `africa` (remember we want to merge this
# into the gapminder data), so just select the columns we need
africa <- africa %>% dplyr::select(name = name_long, geometry)

# do a database join to add the sfc (simple feature column: the geometry) to 
# the gapminder data
africa_gap <- inner_join(gapminder, africa, by = c("country" = "name"))
class(africa_gap)

# inner_join resets object class so not an sf object any more. Need to tell R
# again that its an sf object
africa_gap <- st_as_sf(africa_gap)
